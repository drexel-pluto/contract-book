# Contributing

### Prerequisites 

Need to have `docsify-cli` installed. In terminal run one of the following two commands:

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
#or 
yarn global add docsify-cli
```

### Editing/Previewing

The source files all exist in the `docs` directory. All files are written in markdown, and then formatted by docsify.js to make it all nice and pretty. 

If you need more pages, you can simply create more markdown files in the `docs` directory. The sidebar will mimic the directory structure inside there.

To preview the site locally on your machine, you can run `docsify serve docs` in the root of the project.
