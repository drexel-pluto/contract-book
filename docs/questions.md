# Questions

This is our running list of questions that we intend to answer with our research. Each of these questions we consider core to the functionality of pluto.

### For Users

- Do you find Instagram to be more trustworthy than Facebook? Why?
- What do you think of a daily image cap? You can only post x images a day to give each image more inherit value.

### Security

- What is the intent of the users if something is secure?
- What kind of content do they want to share that they care is private?

### Content

- What kind of content do we want our users to share and contribute?
- Is the reason why people share rarely connected to the way in which social media is public and open to hundreds of people, or is this simply a factor of human nature?
- What is more important, the content or the people who post it?
- Do people want to hide the date and time and just look at the information?
- What drivers can we create to encourage people to post if ‘follows’ or ‘likes’ are eliminated?
- What can we do to foster communication within the app?
- All comments are hidden? Should all comments on things be sent as a direct message to that person?
- Only emoji reactions public?

### Sustainability

- ”How will you make money and remain sustainable?” 
- How can we balance restriction while still providing and building a community
- How can we make each relationship feel valuable?
- How can our application supplement existing platforms?
- Is our platform meant to be used exclusively?
- How can our platform create cohesion between platforms without encouraging crossposting/communication between these platforms?

### Monetization

- How can we scale payments on this app and make it worthwhile?
- How can we add a subscription fee and make it worthwhile?
- Wouldn’t users want some degree of exclusivity for this to be worth the money?
- Is security the key factor only?
