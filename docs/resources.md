## Communication

### Slack

We will be using primarily slack for group communication, due to the ability to categorize content into different channels. We've broken our workspace into the following topics:

- **design**: design assets and questions
- **development**: development assets, task management
- **research**: research related conversations and documents
- **inspo**: design/functionality inspiration 
- **timesheet**: task management and strategy
- **general**: team discussion, announcements, meetings
- **docs**: repository for important or useful documents

## Resource Management Tools

### Google Drive

All Resources related to the project are stored in google drive. The live collaboration offered by the platform is unparalleled. 

Naming Convention for drive files: 

- `documentName-moreInfo-XX_YYYYMMDD.filetype`
- document name should be formated in camel case (camelCase)
- XX is to note where the document should be living, marked by the 2 digit shorthand labeled in each folder

### Github

Industry standard for development collaboration. Gives us advanced version control and issue tracking all in one free package. Our project is broken into 2 main repositories, one for the frontend and one for the backend. Our organization can be found at [https://github.com/drexel-pluto](https://github.com/drexel-pluto).

### Zenhub

Built as a plugin on top of our github repositories, zenhub is an agile project manager. It allows us to track what tasks everyone is working on, and ensures everybody knows what they can or should be working on at all times. Currently, our zenhub board is organized into 6 main pipelines:

- **New Issues:** Newly created issues land here automatically.
- **Icebox:** Low priority, un-prioritized Issues that are not immediate priorities.
- **This Week:** High priority issues for the current sprint, organized by priority.
- **In Progress:** What the team is currently working on.
- **Review / QA:** Issues open to the team for review and testing. Code is ready to be deployed pending feedback.
- **Done:** Issues that are tested and ready to be deployed to production.

Additionally, each issue is tagged with at least one of the following four main epics:

- Strategy
- Research
- Design
- Development

### Shotgun

While zenhub allows us to easily see in detail what items are in our current sprint and whats next in the queue, Shotgun is our tool for more long term planning. It's suite of tools includes task management and gantt charts. These features allow us to make sure we're on the right track for the larger milestones.
