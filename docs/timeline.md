## Fall

Fall will be very heavy on research. This time will be spent confirming our feelings and suspicions about the current state of social media. Our efforts will be focused on getting in touch with as many people as we can via surveys, online, and in-person interviews to get their input and opinion on our ideas.

Additionally, we plan to begin investigating some of the initial stages for the following steps. Based on our research, we hope to establish some element of logo and branding, initial interface designs, and initial development environments.

#### Fall goals:
- Contract Book
- High-level Interface Design
- High-level Marketing
- High-level Development

## Winter

Winter will be spent putting all the knowledge gained from the fall research to use. Once we've established our information architecture and core features, we will be developing several prototypes of increasing fidelity, all the while building out the functionality in our front and back end. Once we're satisfied with our design prototypes, we will match them in code. 

#### Winter goals:

- Interface design
- Interface prototypes
- Interface testing
- Finalize design system
- Finalize logo
- Backend development
- Frontend development
 
## Spring

Spring term is primary final touches. We will be refining the interactions on our application, adding in advanced animations and micro-interactions. Our hope is to deliver the final version of our app with enough time to get it in the hands of the user before our presentation. 

#### Spring goals:
- Finalize frontend design
- Finalize frontend development
- Finalize backend development
