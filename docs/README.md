# What is this?

Welcome to the contract book for Pluto! This document will serve as an outline of the project, including plans, goals, ongoing work, finished work, and more. The team plans on updating this document as the process continues.

The idea of a contract book came from the 6th Edition of _Product Design and Development_, written by Karl Ulrich and Steven Eppinger. As stated in the book:
> A contract book [should] be used to document the project plan and the results of the concept development phase of the development process. [...] The document represents an agreement between the development team and the senior management of the company about project goals, direction, and resource requirements.

# Who are we?

Pluto will be developed by six members of the Interactive Digital Media program at Drexel University as our senior capstone project. While we're all involved in every part of the process, each member has a specialty and will guide the rest of the team through that piece:

- **Sarah Bray**, Project Management

# Senior project

Senior project challenges students to produce professional-level media assets for a team based senior project in a simulated real-world production environment. It requires a project that demonstrates the
integration of the academic and practical knowledge the student has acquired in the overall field
as well as in one or more specializations. Teams should be able to not only defend how they are
producing their projects but also why they are making them â€“ in the context of contemporary
society and new media theory.

# Advisors

Pluto will be advised by the Program Director of the Interactive Digital Media program, Troy Finamore. Throughout the three terms, meetings between Pluto and Troy Finamore will take place at least once per week.

Rob Lloyd, the Director of Senior Project, will also be advising the creation of Pluto, meeting at least once per week.
