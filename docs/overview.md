This is a question we get just about every time we pitch our idea, and it's a really good one, but unfortunately one that we don't have a solid answer to. yet.

It makes sense why this is a major concern for people. We're proposing creating a social media service, but without any of the traditional means of monetization for a social media service. If you can't sell data, and you can't sell ads, then what can you sell?

Most of the ideas we are looking to entertain in our future testing revolve around subscription fees. Our initial surveys had us optimistic, with 20% of our 250 respondents saying they'd be willing to pay for a social media platform. In order to make our platform more appealing to the remaining 80%, we're considering employing ideas like a freemium system or referral model.
