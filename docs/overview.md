## The problem

Today's social media platforms come with a lot of flaws that we as consumers have accepted as necessesities of the medium, when in reality this is not the case. I'm referring to:

- targeted advertisement
- influencers and sponsored posts
- collection and distribution of your data
- autonomous bots

With each of these items, your feed gets increasingly bogged up with content you never wanted to see in the first place. 

Additionally, because of these factors privacy is becoming a growing issue. Many feel that the content they post to social media is essentially public. Parents are warned not to post pictures of their kids, and every one of us is conditioned not to share private information. Doesn't this defeat the original purpose of social media?

## Our solution

We're building a native mobile application that not only encourages meaningful connections, but enforces it. We're hoping that this will "trim the fat" from your feed. We can **remove** the items listed above, plus *that guy who you haven't talked to since highschool* and additional "obligatory" relationships. This will leave your feed with solely content that really feels valuable. Not only that, but it will also give you a platform where you can feel secure in every piece of content you share.

### Potential features

- Low friend cap
- Granular control over who sees your content
- **You** own your content. Not us.
- Content decay - set a specific amount of time each item will be visible

## Our Mission

> Creating a social network that prioritizes exclusively meaningful connections, giving users a platform that strengthens close relationships with an increased sense of privacy and security.

## Target Audience

Though our app is of course intended to be used across generations and social groups, we're targeting people who fit the following criteria:

- Age 18-25
- American
- Pursuing or completed bachelors degree
- Technologically adept
- Concerned about online privacy/security

## Idea Validation

Our research proves that our initial assumptions regarding meaningful relationships (or lack thereof) and insecurity online are in fact valid. Refer to the [research](research.md) page for more information.

## Economic Analysis

> "How can pluto be sustainable?"

This is a question we get just about every time we pitch our idea, and it's a really good one, but unfortunately one that we don't have a solid answer to. yet.

It makes sense why this is a major concern for people. We're proposing creating a social media service, but without any of the traditional means of monetization for a social media service. If you can't sell data, and you can't sell ads, then what can you sell?

Most of the ideas we are looking to entertain in our future testing revolve around subscription fees. Our initial surveys had us optimistic, with 20% of our 250 respondents saying they'd be willing to pay for a social media platform. In order to make our platform more appealing to the remaining 80%, we're considering employing ideas like a freemium system or referral model.
